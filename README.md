# MedDev: Medical Device Regulatory Approval Sunlight License

This is the home repo for MedDev, an attempt to construct a new kind of free-libre open source license aimed specifically at medical devices.
The COVID-19 pandemic has demonstrated the need for open, transparent devices which are both suppy-chain resilient and fully tested under
normal regulatory regimes. In order to build a system of for-profit and non-profit firms that support such devices to alleviate want 
now and in the future, we believe a license that encourages a new kind of sharing is required: one that allows re-use of device designs
and test documentation by forcing publication at the time of reuse for regulatory clearance.

# Current Documents

Our [current legal draft](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PKiICLM_oCu_4w9RXFBXlSuWMaFJyENu6cKxtvP-3EY/edit?usp=sharing) is here. We are actively seeking attorneys to help us complete this draft.

We have a set of [loose notes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PVDh55CssjKDlNG06Blz3yN5ZMRx6sKONC2ysyCE6x0/edit?usp=sharing) as a working document.

We can of course give editing privileges to people who join this project. We are interested in volunteers with regulatory (especially FDA) experience, government policy and health experience, and, in particular, lawyers with experience with free-libre open source licenses.

The diagram in the directory may give you a general idea of our approach.

## A Related Motivation

Based on some work by Sabrina Merlo of OSMS, I wrote [this essay](https://www.pubinv.org/2021/03/03/a-new-kind-of-fda-clearance-design-clearance/) proposing a new kind of FDA clearance.  This is independent of the license, but it is related as a motivational work, so I'm linking it here. It has been submitted to the [Day One Project](https://www.dayoneproject.org/).
